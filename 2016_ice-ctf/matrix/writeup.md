matrix.txt was the input file

Swap the hex to binary and drawing each 1 as a black pixel and each 0 as a white pixel returned a qr code as seen in `qr.png`.

Some of the columns and rows were duplicated, so the QR could not be scanned. I could have tweaked the code to fix it but instead I threw it in an image editor and manually fixed it as seen in `fixed-qr.png` which resulted in the key.
